# Energy Dynamics: Analyzing Coal Production and Exploring Solar Alternatives

## Introduction

Welcome to the Energy Dynamics project repository associated with Fergusson College. This project delves into the intricate balance between conventional energy sources, particularly coal, and the burgeoning interest in solar energy as a sustainable alternative.

## Background

In October 2021, India faced a critical fuel shortage crisis due to surging energy demands amidst the post-pandemic economic rebound. The coal scarcity prompted a reevaluation of energy policies, highlighting the urgency to explore alternative sources such as solar energy.

## Objective

The primary aim of this project is to comprehensively analyze the behavioral patterns in coal production and its domestic demand while evaluating its environmental impact, particularly in terms of CO2 emissions and electricity generation. Additionally, we seek to gauge public awareness and perceptions regarding solar energy as a viable alternative.

## Methodology

- **Time Series Analysis:** Utilizing time series plots, we examine the consistent rise in coal consumption and employ extrapolation and the ARIMA model for forecasting after addressing data irregularities.
- **Model Comparison:** We compare the accuracy of the Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA models for coal production data, concluding the superiority of the ARIMA model.
- **Regression Analysis:** Initially, linear regression did not reveal a clear relationship between Coal Production and CO2 Emission, as well as Coal Production and Electricity Generation. However, after applying the Box-Cox Transformation, linear correlations emerged in both models.

## Key Findings

- The ARIMA model provides robust forecasting capabilities for coal production trends.
- Linear correlations between coal production and environmental impacts (CO2 emissions, electricity generation) were elucidated post-Box-Cox Transformation.
- Public opinion surveys underscored growing interest and receptiveness towards solar energy adoption.

## Conclusion

Through meticulous analysis and modeling, this project sheds light on the complex interplay between conventional energy reliance and the imperative shift towards sustainable alternatives. By understanding these dynamics, policymakers and stakeholders can make informed decisions to navigate the energy landscape towards a more sustainable future.
