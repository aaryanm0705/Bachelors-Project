In October 2021, as the economy rebounded from the second wave of the pandemic, a substantial surge in energy demand led to a severe fuel shortage in India's coal-fired thermal stations. This crisis prompted the Indian Railways to prioritize the delivery of coal rakes, resulting in the cancellation of several trains across the country.

The project's primary objective is to analyze the behavioral patterns in coal production and its domestic demand, while also assessing the environmental impact in terms of CO2 emissions and electricity generation. Additionally, a survey was conducted to gauge public awareness and opinions on solar energy as a potential alternative.

Examining the consistent rise in coal consumption through time series plots, we employed extrapolation and the ARIMA model for forecasting after addressing data irregularities. Comparing the accuracy of the Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA models for coal production data, it was concluded that the ARIMA model was more suitable for the dataset.

Using Linear Regression, we initially didn't identify a linear relationship between Coal Production and CO2 Emission, as well as Coal Production and Electricity Generation. However, after applying the Box-Cox Transformation, it revealed linear correlations in both models.
